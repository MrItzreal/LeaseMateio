![Demo of the application]()

## 💡 Purpose

I created this application to:

- Practice integrating a React frontend with a Spring Boot backend.
- Gain hands-on experience using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Clerk for frontend development.
- Learn how to structure and manage a backend using Spring Boot with PostgreSQL.
- Use Supabase for database hosting and simplified setup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React** – UI library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed language for more reliable and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive UI styling.
- **Clerk** – Authentication and user management.

### Backend

- **Spring Boot** – Java-based backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Maven** – A build tool for Java projects. Using a project object model (POM), Maven manages a project's compilation, testing, and documentation.
- **PostgreSQL (PSQL)** – Relational database system.
- **Supabase** – Managed backend-as-a-service used to host the PostgreSQL database.

## 📦 Features

- User authentication and sign-in with Clerk.
- .
- Persistent storage using PostgreSQL via Supabase.
- Full RESTful API integration between frontend and backend.
